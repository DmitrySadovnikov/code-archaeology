# Code Archaeology: Ancient Egyptian Challenges

## Introduction
In this activity, you will explore two ancient Egyptian challenges: trade route optimization and pyramid resource calculation. Both challenges involve identifying errors in logic and refactoring code for better readability and maintainability.

## Challenges

1. **Trade Route Optimization**: Review the trade route optimization program and identify Ahmose's mistake. Refactor the code to improve its logic and readability.
2. **Pyramid Resource Calculation**: Identify errors in the pyramid resource calculation logic and correct them. Refactor the code for better maintainability.

## Setup Instructions
For specific setup instructions, please refer to the README files in each language directory:
- [COBOL Setup](cobol/README.md)
- [Fortran Setup](fortran/README.md)
- [Lisp Setup](lisp/README.md)
- [Prolog Setup](prolog/README.md)

## Task
- **Understand the Code**: Review the programs and understand their logic.
- **Identify Mistakes**: Look for logical errors or inefficiencies in the code.
- **Refactor the Code**: Improve the code's readability and maintainability. Consider adding comments or simplifying the logic.
- **Write Tests**: Create unit tests to ensure the programs work correctly for different inputs.

# Code Archaeology: Ancient Egyptian Trade Route Optimization

## Introduction
In this activity, you will explore an ancient Egyptian trade route optimization program written by the renowned mathematician **Ahmose**. Ahmose, known for his work on the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, was tasked by Pharaoh Khafre to optimize trade routes between major cities like **Thebes**, **Memphis**, and **Alexandria**. However, Ahmose made a critical error in his calculations, leading to inefficiencies in trade.

## Challenge Overview
Your task is to identify Ahmose's mistake, correct it, and refactor the code for better readability and maintainability. You will work with programs written in different programming languages: COBOL, Fortran, Lisp, and Prolog.

## Setup Instructions
For specific setup instructions, please refer to the README files in each language directory:
- [COBOL Setup](cobol/README.md)
- [Fortran Setup](fortran/README.md)
- [Lisp Setup](lisp/README.md)
- [Prolog Setup](prolog/README.md)

## Task
- **Understand the Code**: Review the program and understand how it calculates the shortest distance between cities.
- **Identify Ahmose's Mistake**: Look for any logical errors or inefficiencies in the code.
- **Refactor the Code**: Improve the code's readability and maintainability. Consider adding comments or simplifying the logic.
- **Write Tests**: Create unit tests to ensure the program works correctly for different inputs.
